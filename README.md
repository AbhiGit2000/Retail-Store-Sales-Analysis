### Project Overview

This project analyzes two years of retail transaction data to uncover key drivers of sales performance, customer behavior, and promotional effectiveness. Using Power BI, the dashboard converts raw transactional data into clear, decision-ready insights that help stakeholders optimize pricing, promotions, and customer retention strategies.



## Business Questions Answered

This project was designed to answer critical business questions such as:

What is driving overall sales growth across regions and categories?

Which product categories contribute the most to total revenue?

How effective are different promotional strategies?

Are customers returning or making only one-time purchases?

Which customer segments deliver the highest lifetime value?

How dependent is the business on discount-based sales?


## Key Business Insights

Generated $2.5B in total sales from approximately 1 million transactions over two years.

The Toys category consistently leads sales across all states and promotion types.

100% of revenue is discount-driven, indicating heavy dependence on promotions and lack of organic demand.

Customer retention rate: 0%, highlighting an urgent need for loyalty and CRM strategies.

The “20% Off” campaign outperforms BOGO and Flash Sale promotions in revenue generation.

Medium-spending customers (≈44%) contribute the largest share of revenue.

State Z leads with $835M in revenue, though regional performance variance remains minimal overall.
