-Objective

To analyze two years of retail transaction data and deliver actionable insights on sales performance, promotional effectiveness, and customer behavior using Power BI.

-Project Summary

This project builds an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks key metrics across regions, categories, and time periods.
It helps business stakeholders quickly identify what’s driving revenue and where improvements are needed.

-Key Business Insights

1.Total Sales: $2.5B from ~1M transactions over two years.

2.Toys category consistently leads sales across all states and promotions.

3.Promotional Dependency: 100% of sales are discount-driven — no organic sales.

4.Retention: 0% returning customers → strong need for loyalty/CRM strategy.

5.Promotion Performance: “20% Off” generates the highest revenue vs “BOGO” and “Flash Sale.”

6.Customer Segmentation: Medium spenders (~44%) dominate revenue contribution.

7.Regional: State Z leads ($835M), but overall regional variance is minimal.

-Technical Workflow

1. Data Preparation:

Cleaned raw transaction data in Power Query (handled missing values, normalized fields).

2. Data Modeling:

Built Star Schema linking Fact_Transactions with dimension tables (Customers, Products, Promotions, Stores).

3. DAX Measures:

Created metrics: Total Sales, AOV, Retention Rate %, Promo Sales %, and Sales Growth %.

4. Visualization:

Designed KPI cards, trend charts, and promotional comparison visuals.

Added drill-throughs and tooltips for category-level insights.
